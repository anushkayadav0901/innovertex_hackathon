### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Stage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  position: [number, number, number];
  type: 'gate' | 'valley' | 'tower' | 'arena' | 'podium';
}

interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  members: string[];
  stageIndex: number;
  submissionLink?: string;
  color: string;
  rank?: number;
}
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Accessing the Quest Map
1. Navigate to `/quest-map` in your browser
2. Or click "Quest Map" in the navigation bar
3. The 3D world will load with all teams and stages

### Interacting with the Map
- **Mouse Controls**: 
  - Left click + drag: Rotate camera
  - Right click + drag: Pan camera
  - Scroll wheel: Zoom in/out
- **Team Interaction**:
  - Hover over team avatars for quick info
  - Click team avatars for detailed information
- **Stage Information**:
  - Hover over stages to see descriptions

### Team Management
The system supports dynamic team updates:
- Teams automatically move when their stage is updated
- New teams can be added dynamically
- Rankings are reflected on the winner's podium

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Stages
1. Define stage in `useQuestMapData.ts`
2. Create 3D component in `HackathonQuestMap.tsx`
3. Add to stage rendering switch statement

### Modifying Team Appearance
- Colors: Update team color in data
